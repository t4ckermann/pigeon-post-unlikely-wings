# Game Mechanics Overview:

## 1. Navigation to Target Locations:

**Objective:** Percy needs to find and fly to specific buildings marked as points of interest in various towns to collect evidence.
**Implementation:** Use a top-down bird's eye view with an intuitive UI element, like an arrow or compass, to guide players towards the target. This could be implemented using Phaser's camera and sprite systems, with the target locations pre-defined in each level's design.

## 2. Infiltration and Evidence Collection:

**Objective:** Once at the target location, Percy flies into an open window and begins searching the building room by room.
**Implementation:** Switch to a point-and-click adventure style within the building. Players tap on objects to investigate them, with some items being relevant evidence. Use Phaser's input system to allow players to select items. Implement an inventory system limiting how much evidence Percy can carry, encouraging players to choose wisely.

## 3. Return to Resistance Base:

**Objective:** After collecting evidence, Percy must return to the resistance base to hand over the evidence, where it's used to create flyers or letters.
**Implementation:** Reuse the navigation mechanic to return to the base. Upon arrival, trigger a cutscene or UI update showing the evidence being handed over. This could involve simple animations or dialogue boxes.

## 4. Distribution of Information:

**Objective:** Percy delivers letters to influential figures or drops flyers in public places to spread awareness and counter fascist propaganda.
**Implementation:** For letter delivery, specific targets (e.g., embassies, public figures) can be marked on the map. For flyer distribution, implement a mechanic where Percy flies over gathering spots, and players tap or swipe to release flyers at the right moment.

## 5. Impact and Progress Measurement:

**Objective:** The relevance of the collected evidence affects the game's progress in combating fascism in the region.
**Implementation:** Create a system that evaluates the evidence's impact based on its relevance. This could involve a scoring system or direct narrative consequences reflected in the game world, such as seeing more resistance symbols or fewer fascist activities in the towns.
Development Steps:
Prototype Key Mechanics: Begin with basic implementations of the navigation, evidence collection, and information distribution mechanics. Focus on getting the feel right for each part, especially the switch between flying/navigation and point-and-click exploration.

## Level Design:

Design levels that incorporate these mechanics, with each town or building offering unique challenges and evidence to collect. Consider how layout, enemy placements, and puzzle elements can create engaging gameplay.

## Narrative Integration:

Integrate the gameplay mechanics with the game's narrative. Ensure that the evidence collected and the outcomes of distributing information align with the story progression and player's impact on the game world.

## Playtesting and Balancing:

Test the game extensively to balance the difficulty, ensure the mechanics are intuitive and fun, and that the narrative impact of the player's actions is clear and satisfying.

## Polish and Refinement:

Based on playtesting feedback, refine the UI, controls, and gameplay mechanics. Add polish to the game's visuals and audio to enhance the overall experience.

By following these steps, you can develop engaging and meaningful gameplay that not only entertains but also educates players on the importance of resistance and vigilance against fascism, all through the adventures of Percy the pigeon in "Pigeon Post: Unlikely Wings."
